To do list page! For Multimedia Authoring.

# Project Name: Steps to Success

Use the in-class ToDo list as your starting point. Use generic selectors to add some style / visual updates to the page. Follow the steps listed below to add functionality with CSS, selectors and the ::before and ::after pseudo selectors. Use the reference links provided in the Week 11 module. 

Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.

Assignment Requirements
(Follow the steps described below to update the ToDo list using CSS.)
Add a background image of some kind to the page - theme it however you like, but it should have something to do with a “to-do” list
Add a header to the page and use an H1 tag (and others, if you like) to give your page a creative title. Use an ID attribute and CSS selector to style the header and its content.
Use generic element selectors, IDs and classes where appropriate and make the build your own - change colors, fonts, etc. Feel free to explore Google Fonts as a solution.
Add an input element with a type of checkbox to each “in progress” and each “done” list item in the “in progress” and “done” lists.
When you check an “in progress” list item, use the appropriate selector to also/additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately.
When you check a “done” item, use the appropriate selector to also /additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately.
Use the ::after pseudo selector to add a graphic element indicating completion (check, thumbs up, etc)
